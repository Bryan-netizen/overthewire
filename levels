hexdump data.txt  > hex is what is currently working.This one was a bit annoying as it involved using xxd -r data.txt, reverse hexdump into binary, when  you check the file with file command it shows you what format is was last in. So it was a series of mv file to said format then running decompress on them with the compress program used. Went on 10 times. Howeevr the technique is real.

This one was confusing had to telnet to localost at port 30000 and submit the previous password then gave me password. Also nmap was handy.

2 ways to solve this telnet user port then paste password
cat or echo file | nc localhost 30000 

These two options are clear text methods of sending text over the wire.
